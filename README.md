#### Short Description of our team members and team name: 

Hello there! We are **The FIVES**!

Our group comprises 5 team members who are all currently studying at the National University of Singapore. 

First, we have Richard who is from the Faculty of Science pursuing a major in Data Analytics. In this competition, his role focuses on establishing links between our group’s mobile application and IoT Data, creating a seamless connection between the community and the elderly. 

Second, we have Mark who is also from the Faculty of Science pursuing a major in Data Analytics. In this competition, his role focuses on mobile application development, creating a dynamic and interactive mobile application to enhance user experience.

Third, we have Gabriel who is from the School of Computing. In this competition, his role focuses on the mobile application Chatbot feature, to enable easy reporting of incidents that will be filtered to ensure efficient use of resources.

Fourth, we have Rica who is from the School of Design and Environment pursuing a major in Project and Facilities Management. In this competition, her role focuses on Project Scheduling and idea generation. 

Fifth, we have Kelly who is also from the School of Design and Environment pursuing a major in Project and Facilities Management. In this competition, her role focuses on idea generation of the supporting mobile application features.

  - **A short description of the problem you are tackling, how technology can help, as well as the idea your team is proposing***

The key issue that our team is targeting is the issue of increasing numbers of a vulnerable aging population. We also realised a current deficiency in the non-emergency reporting channels in Singapore. We hope to address this problem through an application that leverages key technologies to improve communications between the on-site incidents, SCDF (Singapore Civil Defence Force) and CFR (Community First Responders) to address a potentially increasing number of elderly related non-emergency incidents. 

This is achieved via the following: 1. A non-emergency reporting channel via an online chatbot, 2. An IoT-based elderly incident reporting channel, 3. A volunteer dispatch system based on the proximity of the incident and the address and proximity of the volunteer. 

The online chatbot and IoT channels greatly increases the system’s ability to catch non-emergency incidents without needing to rely on precious emergency hotlines. However, it is also paramount to utilise community volunteers as CFRs, therefore this system will be notifying volunteers who live nearby to respond to a non-emergency incident so as to increase the number of incidents that can be addressed by recruiting the entire nation for this effort.

We hope to increase the scope of the app by providing an educational and rewards section. The former will provide lessons for the volunteers, and also provide just-in-time resources in case they need to tend to an emergency. The rewards section is simply an additional incentive for users to use the app and get to know its functions and resources.
